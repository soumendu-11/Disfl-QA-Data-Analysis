    "- **Objective**: The goal of this project is to build a model that corrects disfluent questions into their original form.\n",
    "- **Approach**:  I used the mistral-openorca:latest model with the Ollama server and set a prompt to convert disfluent questions into original questions. No model training was performed. I measured the model's performance based on the contextual similarity between the predictions and the original questions.\n",
    "- **Requirements**: For instructions on installing Ollama, please visit this link https://ollama.com/download/windows. After installation, you can pull the mistral-openorca:latest model by running the command: ollama pull mistral-openorca:latest. A requirement.txt file is attached. "
